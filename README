3d-bindgen is a project to write a GObject Introspection binding generator for the Rust programming language (<http://www.rust-lang.org/>).

3d-bindgen is released under the WTFPL; licenses of related components such as grust, GLib, or Rust itself may be more restrictive.

The plan for the project follows two phases:

First, a precursor written in C, "2d-bindgen", will be a proof of concept and testing ground for creating a binding to the GIR library, which allows access to information about GObject-based libraries such as itself and the rest of the GNOME stack.

Then, using the bindings generated by 2d-bindgen, a Rust port of 2d-bindgen (known as 3d-bindgen) will be written, which should be a fully self-hosting solution for generating bindings to GObject-Introspection-compatible libraries for Rust.

The design of the bindings themselves (i.e., the conceptual machinery involved in generating wrapper functions, types, traits, and libraries) is based on those of the grust project by mzabaluev (<https://github.com/mzabaluev/grust/>), which inspired this effort (and with which 3d-bindgen can hopefully be considered collaborative).

Currently it is likely very difficult to compile this code, as both this code and grust itself are somewhat bitrotted. The intent is to maintain a grust repo tracking Rust master (3d-bindgen depends on grust) and use that grust in the development of (2d- and ultimately) 3d-bindgen.
